# avl.tips Google App Scripts

These are the app script files that are associated with the spreadsheet template. `aws.js`, `s3.js` and `util.js` are sourced from [google-apps-script-for-aws](https://github.com/viuinsight/google-apps-script-for-aws) using the `Paste Source into Project` method recommended by them. `config.html` is largely from [google-sheets-to-s3](https://github.com/viuinsight/google-sheets-to-s3).
